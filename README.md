# Weather Data

weather_data is an application used to collect and store weather data from different cities in a local PostgreSQL database. This data can then
be retreived and printed using inline commands entered through an interactive prompt.

Note: To use the application, a user must create their own local postgres database and edit the WeatherGetter constructor arguments to match the
corresponding database settings. Also, the openweathermap API key in the WeatherGetter script is invalid and must be replaced with a valid key.
