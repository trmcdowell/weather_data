# Weather Data

weather_data is a gradle application used to collect and store different cities weather data in a local PostgreSQL database. This data can then
be retreived and printed using inline commands entered through an interactive prompt.

Note: To use the app, you must create your own local postgres database called "weather" and edit the fields in weather getter to match. Also, the
API key in the script is deprecated and must be replaced with your own.
